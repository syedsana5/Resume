                    Vice Captain and opening batter for the Indian women’s cricket team. The highest bid player ever (`3.5 crore) for the Women’s Premier League (WPL). Captain of the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) at the WPL. Represents Maharashtra in domestic cricket. A part of various international cricket teams and leagues. Yet, at heart, Smriti remains that simple Sangli girl who grew up on a healthy dose of cricket since her father was a fan of the game. “I think I’ve always loved cricket,” she shares.</p>
